# Blogs
<hr />
<p class="is-size-5">Our blogs are constructed in three parts: (1) high-level blogs that aim to motivate people with either AI or Science background to learn and join this exciting interdisciplinary field, (2) hands-on blogs on each individual topic (either an AI technique or a scientific problem/discipline), (3) knowledge base that collects the basic explanations of terminologies.</p>
